# K-Means Project

This project is the implementation of the K_Means algorithm

## Introduction

In this project, we are going to classify 100 three-dimensional points into k clusters with K-Means algorithm.
In this project, the user enters the number of clusters.
the program clusters the points into k clusters and displays each cluster with its center in the output.

## Code

Here's the Python functions for the "K_Means" program:

### clean_data:
data cleaning function

### calculate_distance
distance calculate function

### K_means
K-means alghorithm function


## attributes

### set_points
Cleared data

### k
centroid number

### centroid
centroids

### f_clusters
clusters and centers
